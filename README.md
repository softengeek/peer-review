**Things I Couldn't Complete in Time:** 
* Skeleton Loading
* Nice to Have UI features
* Rating and Flagging of Each Question with a Progress Bar
* Splash Screen

**What i would have done differently if i had 1 week to work finish:**
- Polish the UI some more
- Add the things i couldn't complete in time
- Simulate a database with the localstorage
- Improve CSS styling method used
- Add automated and unit testing to the project
